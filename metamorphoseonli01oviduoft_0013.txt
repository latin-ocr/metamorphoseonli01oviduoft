ωτι-ἰαὶ to the sixth book, when ovid was suddenly
ordered to leave Rome and betake himself to Tomis, or
Tomi, a town on the shores os the Pontus Euxinus,

various conjectures have been bazaz-decl aa to the cause
of thie severe and sudden punishment. Its severity

or Hmmerfeat. As Corinna luis been identified with tho
elder Julian, eo has Ovid's exile been connected with the
younger: and it is a noticeuble fact that Julia was exiled
in the same year. lt appears probable that the reason

Rome: but what thut was we cannot tell. Had the
cauno been any positive crime. Ovid would probably have
neven-referred to it at all. while there was hope of pardon.
