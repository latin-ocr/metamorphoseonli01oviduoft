prodigious length of the poem, we cannot regard the
Metamorphoses in any light but that of a collection os
episodeS. Many of these episodes are of great beanty,
as the tale of Baucis and Philemon in book viii„ of
Orpheus and Eurydice in book x.‚ of Hyacinthus in
the.same book. And we find scattercd through the
poem descriptions of scenery which we cannot believe
to be merely artificial, but which must have been drawn
directly from nature, such, for instance, as the descrip-

and, if in places we find him frigid or rhetorical, we are
compensated by the number, variety, and beauty of the
episodes which he gives us.

earliest literary work, both poetic and dramatic, and
is discernible in The Tempest‚ his latest play. In the
Bodleian there is a copy of the Aldine edition of Ovid's
Metamorphoses (1502), and on the title is the signature
