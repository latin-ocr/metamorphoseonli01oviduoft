clusively—-to bc a genuine autograph of the poet.' In
nthe same passage, Mr. Lee tells us that some seven
editions of an English version of thc Metamorphoses by
Arthur Golding were iss-uod between 1565 and 1597.
And in Shakespearc's Venus and Adonis the influence of
Ovid’s rendering of the story in the Metamorphoses is
apparent in many of the details.

The Italian poets 'sasso and Ariosto‚ Spenser and
Milton among the English. were alike indebted to Ovid
and particularly to the Metamorphoses. In Milton
especially we can see the strong impression that the
poem has left: over and over again his allusione to
ancient mythology and geography recall Ovid: in the

sequeI, the stom* of Deucalion and Pyrrha, ll. 313—415.
The renewal of the animal world follows, 11. 416-45Ι,·
and then the episode of Apollo and Daphne, ll. 452-567,
of Jupiter and Io, ll. 568—7 503 within which is set that of
Pan and SyrinX, ll. 689-712. The rest of the book begins
the story of Phaethon, which extends into Book II.

In Tristia, i. 7, Ovid tells us that ab the time of his
exile the Metamorphoses,

‘Carmina mutatas hominum dicentia formas‚'

were incomplete. and that he threw the poem upon the
